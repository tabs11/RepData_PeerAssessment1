options(warn=-1)
```

### Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
atv_data <- read.csv('./data/activity.csv')
```

#### 2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

First, Let's have a look on the data
```{r}
str(atv_data)
```

Convert *date* field to date format
```{r}
atv_data$date<-as.Date(strptime(atv_data$date,'%Y-%m-%d'))
```

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

#### 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

With **dplyr** package, we can group the data by the *date* variable and sum the *steps* variable
```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

steps_day<- atv_data %>% 
        group_by(date) %>%
        summarise(
                count_steps = sum(steps),
        )
```
For a quick overview of the aggregated data
```{r message=FALSE}
head(steps_day)
```

#### 2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

With **ggplot2** package we can get the requested histogram
```{r message=FALSE, fig.width=8,fig.height=5}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(steps_day, aes(x=count_steps)) + 
        geom_histogram(bins=40,
                       color="black",fill="white") + 
        labs(title="Number of steps per day", 
             x='Steps', 
             y='Count')
```

#### 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

I also included the standard deviation
```{r message=FALSE}
mean_median_sd<-
        as.data.frame(
                cbind(
                        Mean=mean(steps_day$count_steps,na.rm=T),
                        Median=median(steps_day$count_steps,na.rm=T),
                        Standard_Deviation=sd(steps_day$count_steps,na.rm=T)
                        )
                )
mean_median_sd
```
### What is the average daily activity pattern?

#### 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

First we need to do another aggregation, but now grouping by *interval* instead of *date*
```{r message=FALSE}
mean_steps_intv<- atv_data %>% 
        group_by(interval) %>%
        summarise(
                mean_steps = mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE),
        )
```
Then we can do a time series plot using **ggplot2**
```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(mean_steps_intv, aes(x=interval, y=mean_steps)) +
        geom_line() + 
        labs(title="Average of Total steps per 5min interval", 
             x='Interval', 
             y='Mean of total steps')
```

#### 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

We can use **which.max** function to find the index and then search for the rows
```{r message=FALSE}
mean_steps_intv[which.max(mean_steps_intv$mean_steps),]
```

### Imputing missing values

#### 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs

We can sum the True and False array generated by **is.na** function
```{r message=FALSE}
sum(is.na(atv_data))
```

#### 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

Since the mean imputation decreases the variance and therefore increases the bias narrowing
the accuracy and the confidence interval, using k-Nearest Neighbour imputation looks like to be a better option.

#### 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

We need to download the package **VIM** and then use the function **KNN** to replace the NA values by the k-Nearest Neighbour
```{r message=FALSE}
library(VIM)
atv_data_knn<-kNN(atv_data,variable = "steps")
summary(atv_data_knn)
```

#### 4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

First, wee need to do a similar aggregation by *date* with the new dataset
```{r message=FALSE}
steps_day_knn<- atv_data_knn %>% 
        group_by(date) %>%
        summarise(
                count_steps = sum(steps),
                mean_steps = mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE),
                median_steps = median(steps,na.rm=TRUE)
        )

```
Then we can compare the plots
```{r message=FALSE, fig.width=8,fig.height=5}
plot1<-ggplot(steps_day, aes(x=count_steps)) + geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white")
plot2<-ggplot(steps_day_knn, aes(x=count_steps)) + geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white")

require(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)
```

Since we are putting new values based on KNN imputation and these imputed values are not extreme, the mean and median are reduced and the variance is slightly increased which makes sense.
```{r message=FALSE}
mean_median_sd_knn<-
        as.data.frame(
                cbind(
                        Mean=mean(steps_day_knn$count_steps,na.rm=T),
                        Median=median(steps_day_knn$count_steps,na.rm=T),
                        Standard_Deviation=sd(steps_day_knn$count_steps,na.rm=T)
                        )
                )
mean_median_sd_knn
```

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

#### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

For make it universal I set the **weekdays** function output to english
```{r message=FALSE}
sys_eng<-Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "C")
```
Then using **ifelse** conditions we can create the required factor variable 
```{r message=FALSE}
atv_data_knn$weekday<-ifelse(
        weekdays(atv_data_knn$date)=="Saturday" | weekdays(atv_data_knn$date)=="Sunday",
        "Weekend day", 
        "Weekday")

atv_data_knn$weekday<-as.factor(atv_data_knn$weekday)
summary(atv_data_knn)
```

#### 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

First we need to aggregate by *interval* and *weekday* fields
```{r message=FALSE}
steps_day_knn_weekday<- atv_data_knn %>% 
        group_by(interval,weekday) %>%
        summarise(
                count_steps = sum(steps),
                mean_steps = mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE),
                median_steps = median(steps,na.rm=TRUE)
        )

```

Then we can use **ggplot2** and set the **facet_grid** parameter as *weekday*
```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(steps_day_knn_weekday, aes(interval, mean_steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(weekday ~ .)
```

There are some differences in number of steps taken between week days and weekends. Looks like during the weekdays the mean between 500 and 1000 steps is greater than in weekends but the mean between 1000 and 2000 looks greater in weekends than in weekdays.

This might suggest that during the week days people walk because they need to go to work which implies a reasonable and more a less standard amount of steps to be taken.

During the weekends people may have more time to run or have longer walks which implies a more considerable amount of steps.
